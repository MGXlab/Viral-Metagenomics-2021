## Install Conda
We will use `conda` to handle the dependencies for the workshop. **Please be sure you install it before the workshop**. More info [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

After installing conda, download the dependencies file `workshop_env.yaml` from [here](). Then run:

~~~
# create the environment
$ conda create -n viral_workshop -f workshop_env.yaml

# activate the environment
$ conda activate viral_workshop
~~~
