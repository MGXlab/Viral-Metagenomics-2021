From the previous section we know there are some scaffolds present in almost all samples, and that we can bin them looking at their abundances or depths of coverage in a sample. However, we can achieve a better binning resolution by taking all the samples into account. Look at the table below:





In this way we can differentiate organisms with the same relative abundance in a sample.
